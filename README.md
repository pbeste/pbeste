This is probably the wrong forum for this but I am looking for help. I have my seed words which does access a new metamask account not my old account. I have my private key but when I try to import using it I get one of two error messages. Ethier they are looking for a 0x digit code or a Unit8Array of 32 characters. My account which I also have and checked on Etherscan, which shows the account and the assets does not get accepted and the private key which I have for the account which is greater than 32 characters is not being accepted. Can anyone help me recover my account and crypto assets which are a meaningful amount to me.
